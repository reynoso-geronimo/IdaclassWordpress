###⚡️ FEATURES

**Powerful Custom Product Options**
YayExtra supports a wide range of product field types to serve your diverse use cases.

- Allow customers to input text, number, email, etc.
- Add radio buttons to the original product
- Enable checkbox to allow for privacy policy acknowledgement
- Add button rows to customize the base product
- Add one time fee in percentage or fixed amount
- Add multiple fees to multiple product options
- Display the subtotal for the selected extras

**Multiple Options in an Option Set**
You can add many product custom fields in the same group. Related options can be displayed next to each other or vertically. A product field can trigger the display of the next product field.

**Apply Product Options in Bulk**
A group of product fields can be applied to all products, a group of products in a specific category, a group of products with a specific tag, or hand-picked products.

**WooCommerce Conditional Variations**
YayExtra allows you to create a conditional logic so you can combine it with the existing custom options. Conditional logics help show the next product field if the user has selected a specific option value. 

Let's suppose that you sell car parts, so when the customer chooses to have "Accessories" then related options like "Front door items" or "Replacement kit" can be shown on the current product page. Otherwise, if the customer doesn't check the "Accessories" checkbox then those options will not show up, which keeps your product page neat and clear.

###💎 PREMIUM-ONLY FEATURES

**Advanced Product Addons**
Multiple field types are built in the premium version:

- Image swatches
- Button (multi selectable)
- Swatches (multi selectable)
- Date picker
- Time picker
- File Upload

**Group Separate Products**
Similar to "related products", you will be able to easily use an existing product as another product's swatch or option. For instance, you can add "custom stickers" product to a range of "bag" products. You can add "matched cap" to a "baseball t-shirt" or something like that.

###🔑 HOW IT WORKS

Each field type comes with various elements to help you enhance the extra product options: 

- Required field: Make the customer have to select an option or enter the information so it can be passed through in the order (Free)
- Placeholder: Add help text or expected value to be entered in the field (Free)
- Set as default: Enable a specific option value to be selected upon product page load (Free)
- Custom image: Use uploaded swatch image to show on product featured image (Premium-only)
- File upload: Add a single or multiple file uploads, make file uploads mandatory or optional, and many other options.
- File upload: Allow specific file formats like PNG, JPG, PDF, DOC, XLS, etc.
